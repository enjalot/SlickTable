This is an experimental mashup of SlickGrid and Tabletop to make live spreadsheets from a public google doc


SlickGrid
https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki

Tabletop
http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/

I've copied the SlickGrid js files from the repo into the lib/ folder (as well as Tabletop and other 3rd party js libs we use)

I've also copied the SlickGrid css files into css/slick for convenience.

The main example is based on one of the getting started examples from SlickGrid
http://mleibman.github.com/SlickGrid/examples/example3-editing.html


Because I've moved things around a bit from the SlickGrid directory structure I've had to edit the code and css a little to have proper paths for static assets
